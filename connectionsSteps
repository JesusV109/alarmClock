DS3231 RTC Module to Arduino
The DS3231 RTC communicates with the Arduino via the I2C protocol, requiring only two communication pins (SDA and SCL).
VCC → 5V on Arduino

GND → GND on Arduino

SDA → A4 on Arduino

SCL → A5 on Arduino

LED Matrix to Arduino
We are using a 4-unit LED matrix, and it communicates using SPI protocol, which requires three main communication pins: DataIn, CLK (Clock), and CS (Chip Select).
VCC → 5V

GND → GND

DIN → Pin 12

CS → Pin 10

CLK → Pin 11

Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) to Arduino
The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor uses two pins: one to trigger the ultrasonic pulse and another to receive the echo from the pulse.
VCC → 5V
GND → GND
Trig → Pin 6
Echo → Pin 7

Buzzer to Arduino
The active buzzer is connected to a digital pin on the Arduino. The pin will control the buzzer's on/off state.
Positive ( + ) → Pin 5

Additional Tips:
Make sure to use a breadboard to properly connect the power lines (5V and GND) to multiple components.
After wiring, double-check that all components are receiving the correct voltage and are grounded properly.
You can use jumper wires to make the connections easier, and ensure each connection is secure to avoid intermittent issues.

Negative ( - ) → GND
